# 3DProject
A small project I did during the summer 2016. 
The goal was to code a spinning 3D box on a regular canvas (JavaFX) and handle all logic behind camera, field of view, occlusion, rotation
etc. without using any "3D library".

Things I would improve if I had time:
- multithreading for improved efficiency
- load meshes from a file instead of having it hard coded
- improved occlusion clipping
- texture support
